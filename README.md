# Hi and welcome to my GitHub page!

Check out these repos:

1. Final project of the Academic Work Academy's Google Cloud training course: [Final project](https://github.com/LnikGH/AWA-GCP-final-project.git)
   - Team project in which we combined Covid-19 and currency data sources. The aim was to create a service which can predict a safe holiday location and the currency rate of that country from the data sets with machine learning. User can interact with world map to see Covid-19 situation of the selected country and ask predictions from a chat bot.

2. API project (AW Academy's Google Cloud course): [API project](https://github.com/LnikGH/apiprojekti.git)
   - Team project: task was to combine two APIs into a working solution. We combined GPS location data of bars to satellite data, so you can check if a satellite is overpassing a bar of your choice. Now can you go to afterwork without worrying if your boss is watching you! User can query bar status with GET method from our API. Additionally scheduled API call is done every workday of a chosen bar and results are published in a PubSub topic so your coworkers can subscribe for news about safe afterwork beers!

3. Kubernetes project (AW Academy's Google Cloud course): [Kubernetes project](https://github.com/LnikGH/konttiprojekti.git)
   - Team project: task was to run Flask blogging app on Kubernetes. A load balancer distributes traffic to multiple autoscaled pods. The blog data is kept on different pod with persistent volume.

4. Python demo app for management of laboratory's sample data: [LAB project](https://github.com/LnikGH/LIMS_poc.git)
   - My own project: It does not always make sense to log every sample brought by the R&D department into the sample management system, as it can easily take hours of work time. With this simple Python program, you can manage your samples and their results quickly and easily. The program also keeps a log of changes in results and samples.
