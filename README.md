1. Final project of the Academic Work Academy's Google Cloud training course: [Final project](https://github.com/LnikGH/AWA-GCP-final-project.git)
   - Team project in which we combined Covid-19 and currency data sources. The aim was to create a service which can predict a safe holiday location and the currency rate of that country from the data sets with machine learning. User can interact with world map to see Covid-19 situation of the selected country and ask predictions from a chat bot.
